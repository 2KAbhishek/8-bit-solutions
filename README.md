<h3>Problem Solving with less bits üé±‚è™</h3>

</div>

## What is this

Contains problems solved using 8-bit Assembly.

You can run the code on the [Simulator](https://schweigi.github.io/assembler-simulator/index.html)

## Inspiration

Hadn't worked with assembly since college, seemed like a fun exercise.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Working internet and a web browser

## Getting 8-bit-solutions

To get 8-bit-solutions, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2kabhishek/8-bit-solutions
cd 8-bit-solutions
```

## Using 8-bit-solutions

Use it as a reference for solving problems, or just to get a feel for the language.

You can run the code on the [Simulator](https://schweigi.github.io/assembler-simulator/index.html)

## Challenges faced

It was quite tricky to work within the constraints of the language, which in turn allowed me to learn a lot.

## What I learned

- Doing more with less
- Intelligent use of the stack and limited registers

## What's next

More solutions may be added in the future.
